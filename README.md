# The Exciting World of Queries.

![](SQL.png)

## Introduction
This project showcases my dive into the world of Queries using the Structured Query Language (SQL). As a data analyst, enthusiastic about learning and taking on projects, this shows the depth of my learning and progress. 

**_Disclaimer_** ⚠️- _All data used for this analysis are hypothetical data generated and do not represent any company's data or an attempt to endanger their performance._

## Problem Statement
In this project, in a bid to thoroughly advance in the world of SQL, I worked on the following tasks:
- Creating a Database named "Students_Record"
- Creating a Student Info Table with Primary Keys
- Creating a Health Record Table with Primary Keys
- Creating a Performance Table with Foreign Keys
- Use of SELECT functions
- Modification and Altering of tables.

## Skills Demonstrated
In this project, I showcased my ability to create a database and create different tables in the same database. Skills demonstrated in this project include: Database creation, table creation and modification, and use of constraints like primary key, foreign key and not null. 

## Data Sourcing
The data was created from scratch by me. The details used were hypothetically generated by me.

## SQL Fundamentals and Analysis

 - A database named Students_Records was created and three tables, namely, Students_info, Health_records and Performance were created and appropraite values inserted into them.
 - The students_info and health_records tables were both given the primary key constraint to their ID columns, and a constraint that does not allow null values.
 - The Performance table was given the foreign key constraint.
 - The tables were created and executed successfully.
